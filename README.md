# JPACRUDProject

# Description
In this project I had to create a SQL database and a table. I decided to make a database about something I loved doing, baking. I had to make it a JPA project and mapping the entities to SQL tables using JUnit tests to confirm it was properly mapped.
I had to integrate Spring MVC with JPA and be able to use basic CRUD functions.
In this program when it starts up it will show a list of all available recipes. You can search for a recipe by its ID, or you can create a new one. If you search by ID then it will popup with the recipe if one is found, if it is not, you will receive an error page. When a recipe does show then you have the option to either edit or delete it. If you go back to the homepage then you will see the changes.

# Lessons Learned
For this project it was very different than the previous one where we did not use command objects. After learning command objects this project seemed less daunting. It was a lot of fun to create this project and I really enjoyed working with and creating a database.
I was also able to put the application on AWS EC2 with the url http://3.142.85.199:8080/Recipes/
